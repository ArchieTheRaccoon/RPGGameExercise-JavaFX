# RPGGameExercise-JavaFX

This is a small RPG Game made with Tutorial from company SSI SCHÃ„FER IT Solutions.

In the first place this RPG game had to be made in a program named Eclipse with an old AWT UI Builder,
which i didn't like and decided to try to build this program in IntelliJ using the newer and current
JavaFX UI Builder tool.

It gave me some more challenge on the way, because a lot of things i had to build by my own, without the tutorial,
but in the end it will worth it.
